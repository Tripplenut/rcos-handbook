# What You'll Need

All RCOS students will need a few belongings to succeed:

- Computer with internet (recommended specifications below)
- [Git installation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

For software-based projects:

- Text editor or IDE

## Learn Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is an extremely popular version control/collaboration system among open-source projects. To contribute in RCOS, you **WILL** need to learn to use Git (it's not that bad). Try taking [github's git tutorial](https://github.com/git-guides). You can read more about Git and related resources on [this page](resources/README.md#RCOS-Essentials)!

## Recommendations

### Operating Systems

We highly recommend a Unix-based operating system if you choose to work in a code-intensive role.

If you have a Mac, you're all set! Your next step is to familiarize yourself with the terminal if you haven't already.

We highly recommend using a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu through WSL if you have a Windows PC. This will give you access to Linux tools, applications, and the command line while staying on your Windows device! [Follow this guide](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/how-to-install-wsl2-on-windows-10).

### Text Editors and IDEs

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - all-purpose IDE
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - Mac-only, recommended for iOS development
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - minimalist, flexible, easy to use even for beginners
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) - terminal-based text editor, very bare bones (recommended for Raspberry Pi projects as you may not be able to access Sublime on a Pi)

You can learn more about Text Editors and IDEs on the [student resources page](resources/README.md#ides-and-code-editors).

### Software Recommendations

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) - Packs your apps in portable containers for easy deployment across different environments.
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) - Creates virtual machines on your computer, perfect for running multiple operating systems.
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - Simplifies version control with a user-friendly interface for Git, aiding collaboration and code management.
