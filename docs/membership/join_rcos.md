# How to join RCOS

## RPI Students

RCOS runs each semester of the school year, including summer semesters. You can participate by taking the course for credit or no credit. If you take RCOS for credit, you must meet the requirements described in [Grading](grading/README) to receive a grade. If not taking for credit, you can participate in the same way but are not held to any requirements.

### 1. Register for the RCOS Course

When course registration opens, search for RCOS in QuACS or YACS and register for the section with the number of credits you want to take RCOS with. The credit count is factored into grading. You will also be able to show up to the first RCOS meeting of the semester and register via SIS, but it is best to do this as soon as possible! If you have a conflict, contact the faculty advisors for help!

### 2. Register on new.rcos.io

[Sign up at our website](https://new.rcos.io/) to register as an RCOS member in our database. You will initially sign up via email, but you can connect your personal Discord and GitHub profiles as alternate ways to sign in.

### 3. Join our Discord Server

RCOS uses Discord for all communication. You must join the RCOS Discord server for updates, announcements, and team communication throughout the semester. Once you have logged into our website, [connect and link your Discord account](https://new.rcos.io/profile/) on your profile page. This should add you to the Discord server. Here, you can reach out to Faculty Advisors, Coordinators, Mentors, and your fellow members! **If you need help with this, contact a faculty advisor or a coordinator ASAP to be added.**

### 4. Attend First Meeting

The first RCOS meeting of each semester is on either the first Tuesday or Friday of the semester at 4 pm. Typically, these large meetings occur in DCC 318, but always check SIS for the actual location!

<!-- RCOS is a group of RPI students who work on open source projects. Our members work on a variety of projects, which can be seen on the projects page. To see the presentation schedule look here. -->

<!-- Benefits of being an RCOS member -->
<!-- - The opportunity to help society by creating useful software. -->
<!-- - An excellent environment to share your skills with your peers and learn from them as well -->
<!-- - Great practice in the code review process, a very important skill for your software career! -->
<!-- - Practice giving and receiving feedback. Learning how to discuss technical and non-technical aspects of a project in a constructive fashion is a critical skill that employers look for! -->

<!-- Students can participate in RCOS for course credit or for a stipend. At the beginning of each semester, the Internal Advisory Board will review project proposals and decide which projects should receive financial support. -->

<!-- ## Finding a project

[GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore) allows you to explore GitHub and find awesome open source projects to contribute to. Spend a good amount of time finding a project that you like. Don't be intimidated! Many projects that seem very complicated are actively looking for new contributors and will give you "easy" issues to get started. You'll learn fast! Feel free to tackle issues as a team. -->
